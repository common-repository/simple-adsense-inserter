Simple Adsense Inserter immediately inserts adsense adds in all posts and provides you with a adsense widget for your sidebar.

After activating please set your adsense publisher ID in the settings page. That's it... your adds are displayed and you can start earning.

The idea is to instantly get adds in your posts and sidebar (don't forget to add the widget to the sidebar). So if you are looking for a simple way of inserting google adsense to your website, this is the plugin you need.

1.46<BR> Fix for bottomadtype when set to none<BR>
1.45<BR> Bottom add type can now also be set to 'None' (so no add will be shown)<BR>
1.44<BR> On request I made it possible to disable the top add. You can select 'None' in the top addtype in the settings page<BR>
1.43<BR> Removed unnecessary code. This weekend I plan to finish a linksblock widget, so I hope to have the update then.<BR>
1.42<BR> 
1.41<BR> As promised there is now also a new bottom adtype, the square (250x250). I am currently also looking into the possibility for linksblocks (google allows 3 ads and 3 links blocks on 1 page), if you have suggestions on this, please visit my blog and comment<BR>
1.40<BR> Tiny fix. Also this week or next week I will introduce a new adtype for the bottom ad<BR>
1.39<BR> Small fix for when bottom ad type was not set yet<BR>
1.38<BR> Now you can also chose the bottom ad type, you can choose to leave it a banner as it was or chose a big rectangle<BR>
1.37<BR> I added a NEW top ad type, you can also select a Big rectangle now<BR>
1.36<BR> Fix on empty title in widget<BR>
1.35<BR> Small fix of last update<BR>
1.34<BR> Small bugfix on the settings to disable adds<BR>
1.30<BR> Settings to disable adds on posts and/or pages are added (users requested this). It is also possible to disable both and only use the widget if you want.<BR>
1.28<BR> Also the archive pages now show adds on first displayed post of the archive <BR>
1.27<BR> Category pages now show adds on the first displayed post (adsense has a limit of 3 adds per page)<BR>
1.26<BR>
removed reference to unnecessary field<BR>
1.25<BR>
Added link in settings page to my blog to discuss adsense tips<BR>
1.24
Header error fixed and tested
1.23
Fixed an issue which showed an error message when updating
1.22
Fixed header warning message
1.21
Small bugfix that prevented the sidebar add from showing up.
1.20
Now also shows ads on category pages, the ads will be displayed only with the first post to prevent to many ads on one page
There is now an extra option to choose what kind of add you want to have displayed above your post. Before only a square was possible which was left-alligned. Because some people already have a picture there this did not look nice. Now you can also chose to have a centered horizontal rectangle ad on top.

1.10 
Now also Pages show the adds instead of only posts.
